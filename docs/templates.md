# Structured media templates

The native app shares one content and presentation pipeline across PNG, GIF and MP4.
An output format is not a separate template. `paste-card`, `paste-gif` and
`paste-video` remain convenient output presets and shortcut targets.

## Pipeline and ownership

1. Swift captures the input once, plus the destination/clipboard snapshot for a direct shortcut.
2. Core parses source-backed candidate structures, always retaining a document fallback.
3. The configured decision provider chooses a template, variant and motion from valid options.
4. Core validates the choices, measures and lays out the complete content, then creates a Pocket Motion composition.
5. Pocket Motion renders the frames. Core exports PNG/GIF or uses locally available ffmpeg for MP4.
6. Swift previews the output and performs the existing conservative paste checks.

The parser owns words, numbers, speakers, attribution, order and table cells. Jev
only chooses presentation metadata; its response cannot replace source content or
invent missing authors, participants or data. Default local rules work offline.
Configured model errors, malformed answers and low-confidence decisions fall back
to local decisions. This is not a claim that Jev understands every arbitrary input.

## First template set

| Template | Classic | Editorial |
|---|---|---|
| Document | Reading page | Editorial column |
| Quote | Book excerpt | Statement |
| Code | Terminal | Code notebook |
| Statistic | Big number | Metric strip |
| List | Checklist | Stacked steps |
| Conversation | Chat bubbles | Transcript |
| Table | Data grid | Editorial ledger |
| Comparison | Side by side | Split panels |

These variants change composition and typographic hierarchy, not just color.
Flowcharts, timelines, event cards and poetry-specific layouts are later work.
New template implementations must register a parser, presentation options and an
actual renderer; adding a catalog name alone does not create a working template.
Existing palette packs and the legacy DSL render endpoint remain separate from
this version of the template registry.

## Input recognition

Explicit structures take precedence. Examples include fenced source code,
quoted text with an optional explicit author, marked lists, Markdown/TSV tables,
and recognizable before/after or option A/B sections. Conversation recognition
requires evidence of turns: known speaker roles, explicit `[speaker]: message`
labels, or a repeated speaker in a sequence. Arbitrary key/value fields are not
automatically treated as dialogue. Uncertain structures remain document text.

The source may offer more than one compatible template; the native template menu
shows only these candidates. A manual request for an incompatible structure
fails instead of fabricating content. Long content must fit a bounded expanded
canvas or produce an explicit overflow error; new templates do not silently
truncate text to make it fit.

## Output and motion

- PNG always uses the complete static layout, even when a typewriter override was supplied.
- GIF/MP4 can use a still composition, sequential reveal, or typewriter appearance.
- Typewriter appearance uses grapheme clusters and the final layout, keeping line breaks stable.
- Animation has a bounded duration and a readable ending. An unsupported or oversized input is reported explicitly.
- GIF uses at most 128 MiB for retained raw frames (engine and palette memory are additional). It starts at 540 px wide, may reduce to 360 px, and rejects taller animations that still exceed this budget.
- MP4 still requires ffmpeg; this app does not install it automatically.

## Native controls and protocol

`templates.list` returns bilingual names, registered variants and motions. The
`run-action` input accepts `template: {id?, variant?, motion?}` and a
`templatePreferences` dictionary mapping template IDs to saved variant IDs.
Result `meta.template` returns `id`, `variant`, `motion`, `decisionSource` and
`availableTemplates`; it does not repeat source content.

The result view can change template, style, motion and output format using the
original input snapshot. These explicit rerenders do not reread the clipboard or
automatically paste. Changing a style successfully remembers it in native
`settings.json` under `template_styles`; explicit choices take precedence over
saved preferences, which take precedence over automatic style decisions.

The older DSL `render` request remains for deterministic fixtures and CLI
compatibility. Its existing truncation behavior is unchanged; new media actions
use the structured pipeline. Keep those contracts distinct in tests and UI claims.

## Validation

`bun test core/tests` covers parsing, constrained provider decisions, layout,
motion timing and memory bounds. Real engine acceptance is opt-in:

```sh
PEESUTO_TEMPLATE_ENGINE=/absolute/path/to/prepared-engine-copy bun test core/tests/template-engine.test.ts
```

Use a disposable copy of the prepared pinned engine: its build tools write vendor
caches. This test renders all 16 variants and compares the typewriter's final
frame, ending hold and complete PNG export. The macOS render CI runs this suite.
Native bundle and interface acceptance is recorded in
[the template baseline](../baselines/templates-native-0.1.0.md).
